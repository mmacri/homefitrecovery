## Best Practices

### Content Optimization

- **Subject Lines**: Keep subject lines under 50 characters and avoid spam triggers
- **Preheader Text**: Use this to complement the subject line with additional information
- **Content Length**: Aim for emails that can be read in 1-2 minutes
- **Call to Action**: Include a clear, prominent CTA button
- **Images**: Use high-quality images with proper alt text

### Compliance

- **Unsubscribe Option**: Always include a clear, one-click unsubscribe option
- **Physical Address**: Include your business's physical address in the footer
- **Permission**: Only send to customers who have explicitly opted in
- **Privacy Policy**: Link to your privacy policy in every email
- **Transparency**: Clearly identify your business in the sender name and email

### Timing and Frequency

- **Send Time**: Test different times to find when your audience is most responsive
- **Frequency**: Avoid overwhelming subscribers with too many emails
- **Consistency**: Maintain a regular schedule for newsletters and updates
- **Time Zones**: Consider scheduling based on recipient time zones

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Low Open Rates

- Check subject lines for clarity and relevance
- Verify sender name and email are recognizable
- Ensure emails aren't being flagged as spam
- Test sending at different times of day

#### High Unsubscribe Rates

- Review email frequency—you may be sending too often
- Check content relevance to the target segment
- Ensure expectations set during opt-in are being met
- Consider implementing preference centers

#### Technical Problems

- If templates aren't displaying correctly, test across multiple email clients
- For delivery issues, check bounce notifications for specific error messages
- If integration with CRM is failing, verify API connections and permissions
