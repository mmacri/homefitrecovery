The Customer Relationship Management System provides the following key features:

- **Comprehensive Customer Dashboard**: Real-time overview of customer statistics, recent activity, and customer segments
- **Advanced Customer Management**: Create, edit, and manage customer profiles with detailed information
- **Customer Segmentation**: Automatically categorize customers into segments based on their behavior and value

- **Retention Analysis**: Measure and improve customer retention rates
- **Export Functionality**: Export customer data to CSV for external processing or backup

## System Architecture

The Customer Relationship Management System is built with a modular architecture consisting of the following components:

### Core Components

- **Customer Management Core** (`customer-management.js`): Provides the core business logic for customer operations such as creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion.
- **Customer UI Controller** (`customers-ui.js`): Connects the UI elements in the dashboard to the core functionality.
- **Customer Data Storage**: Uses browser localStorage for demonstration purposes, but designed to be easily connected to a backend database.

### Data Models

The system uses the following primary data models:

#### Customer Object

```javascript
{
  id: String,                // Unique identifier (e.g., "CUST-1001")
  name: String,              // Customer name
  email: String,             // Customer email
  phone: String,             // Customer phone (optional)
  address: {                 // Customer address (optional)
    street: String,
    city: String,
    state: String,
    zip: String,
    country: String
  },
  segment: String,           // Customer segment
  preferences: {             // Customer preferences
    emailOptIn: Boolean,     // Email marketing opt-in
    smsOptIn: Boolean        // SMS marketing opt-in
  },
  notes: String,             // Customer notes
  dateCreated: String,       // ISO date string
  dateUpdated: String,       // ISO date string
  lastOrderDate: String,     // ISO date string (optional)
  totalOrders: Number,       // Total number of orders
  totalSpent: Number,        // Total amount spent
  orderIds: Array            // Array of order IDs
}
```

#### Customer Segment Constants

The system supports the following customer segments:

- `new`: First-time customers who have placed one order
- `returning`: Customers who have placed multiple orders and are actively engaging
- `vip`: High-value customers who have placed many orders or spent a significant amount
- `at_risk`: Customers who haven't ordered in a while and may be at risk of churning
- `inactive`: Customers who haven't ordered in a long time and are considered churned

## Customer Lifecycle

Customers typically go through the following lifecycle:

1. **Acquisition**: Customer places their first order and is categorized as a `new` customer
2. **Engagement**: Customer places additional orders and becomes a `returning` customer
3. **Growth**: Customer continues to order and may become a `vip` customer based on spending or order frequency
4. **Retention/Churn Risk**: If a customer hasn't ordered in a while, they become `at_risk`
5. **Churn**: If a customer doesn't return after an extended period, they become `inactive`

Each customer's progress through this lifecycle is tracked and managed through the segmentation system.

## Dashboard Overview

The Customer Management Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all customers and related metrics.

### Key Dashboard Components:

#### 1. Customer Statistics

The top section of the dashboard displays key metrics:
- Total Customers
- Average Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Active Customers
- Retention Rate

#### 2. Customers Table

The main section displays a paginated table of all customers with the following columns:
- Name
- Email
- Orders
- Total Spent
- Last Order Date

#### 3. Customer Insights

The bottom section shows visualizations of:
- Customer segments distribution
- Customer lifetime value by segment

- **VIP Customers**: Customers with 3+ orders OR total spending of $500+
- **At-Risk Customers**: Customers who haven't ordered in 60+ days
- **Inactive Customers**: Customers who haven't ordered in 90+ days

  email: 'jane@example.com',
  phone: '555-5678',
  segment: 'new',
  preferences: {
    emailOptIn: true,
    smsOptIn: false
  }
});
```

  phone: '555-9876',
  segment: 'vip',
  notes: 'Prefers email contact'
});
```

#### Retrieving Customers

```javascript
// Get all customers
const allCustomers = CustomerManagement.getCustomers();

// Get customers with filters
const filteredCustomers = CustomerManagement.getCustomers({
  segment: 'vip',
  dateFrom: '2023-01-01',
  dateTo: '2023-01-31'
});

// Get a specific customer by ID
const customer = CustomerManagement.getCustomerById('CUST-1001');
```

#### Customer Statistics

```javascript
// Get customer statistics for a specific period
const stats = CustomerManagement.getCustomerStatistics('month');
console.log(stats.totalCustomers);
console.log(stats.averageLTV);
console.log(stats.retentionRate);
```

#### Exporting Customers

```javascript
// Export all customers to CSV
const csv = CustomerManagement.exportCustomersToCSV();

// Export filtered customers to CSV
const vipCustomers = CustomerManagement.getCustomers({ segment: 'vip' });
const vipCsv = CustomerManagement.exportCustomersToCSV(vipCustomers);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Customers Not Displaying

If customers are not displaying in the dashboard:

1. Check that the `CustomerManagement` module is loaded correctly
2. Verify that customers exist in the storage
3. Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console

#### Customer Creation Failures

If customer creation fails:

1. Ensure all required fields are provided (name and email)
2. Verify that email addresses are valid
3. Check for duplicate email addresses (each email must be unique)

#### Data Persistence Issues

If customer data is not being saved:

1. Check that localStorage is available and not full
2. Verify that the data being saved is valid JSON
3. Clear browser cache and try again
